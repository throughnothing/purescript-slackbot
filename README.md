# purescript-slackbot

This is my attempt at a very simple slackbot written in
[purescript](http://www.purescript.org).  It's very basic, and the heavy
lifting is done by Slack's
[node-slack-sdk](https://github.com/slackhq/node-slack-sdk).

This is still a major WIP, and mostly being used as a learning experiment.
